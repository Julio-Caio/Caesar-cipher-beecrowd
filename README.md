# Caesar Cifer [Beecrowd 1253 ]

#### In this repository, we have the algorithm created by me to solve question 1253 on the Beecrowd platform. The intention is to convert a string into an encrypted message. The user chooses the shift value that determines the number of positions to shift each character to, similar to the Caesar cipher. For example, suppose I have chosen 3 as the number of positions to shift, and the letter "A". In this case, it would be returned as the letter "D". 
Note: the string should only contain uppercase characters.

## Learnings:

#### In this project, I was able to develop myself in the studies of strings and Lists. Also, in solving this question, I was able to take my initial steps in using functions in Python.
